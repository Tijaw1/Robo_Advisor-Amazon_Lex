# unit13-challenge

This program is a Robo Advisor built using Amazon lex and amazon lambda platforms. The program is meant to be an investment advisor. It takes in the customers personal information and risk appetite and recommends a portfolio that aligns with the customer requirements.

The test scripts are there to test the operation of the lambda function. 

The zipped files are the export files from amazon lex console:
 - Recommended portfolio is the export file for the intent.
 - Robo Advisor is the export file for the bot.
 - Risk Level is the export file for the slot types.
